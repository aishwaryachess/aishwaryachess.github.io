Hi

I am Aishwarya! 

I am a chess coach and International Rated chess player with elo Rating of 1582. I have background in commerce and later decided to pursue my passion in chess. I am interested in exploring ways chess can help child nurture their problem solving skills. Chess is compulsory part of curriculum in many countries such as Russia and Sweden owning to immense benefit this sport brings in a child's life. I wish to envision a day when every child gets opportunity to learn chess in the school right from primary grade and hence taking my first step towards the same. I have also designed and piloted a chess curriculum (iteratively revising it!) for beginners which has shown promise after an overwhelming feedback. Currently, its being implemented in 2 places as part of the after-school chess academy in collaboration with leading institutes in Delhi.
